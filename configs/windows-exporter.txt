Windows Exporter Setup
----------------------
- Installed via MSI (wmi_exporter / windows_exporter)
- Listening on port 9182 (0.0.0.0:9182)
- Issues faced:
    * Prometheus target showed DOWN
    * Context deadline exceeded errors
    * Suspected Norton AV blocking traffic
    * Tried creating Windows Firewall inbound rules:
        - TCP 9182 Allow
        - ICMP Echo Request Allow (ping)
    * Outbound rules tested as well
- Next steps:
    * Verify Norton (or any other anti virus you might have installed) exclusions
    * Double check Windows firewall rules remain active
